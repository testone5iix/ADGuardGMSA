##  Requirements

Before you can run this tool, **make sure your environment is ready:**

 **Windows OS** (10, 11, or Windows Server).

 **PowerShell 5.1+**  
Check with:
```powershell
$PSVersionTable.PSVersion
```

 **RSAT Active Directory module installed.**  
This provides cmdlets like `Get-ADObject`.

###  How to install RSAT:

For Windows 10/11:
```powershell
Get-WindowsCapability -Name RSAT.ActiveDirectory* -Online
Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name Rsat.ActiveDirectory.DS-LDS.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0
```

For Windows Server:
```powershell
Install-WindowsFeature RSAT-AD-PowerShell
```

 **Your machine must be domain-joined** (or at least connected to the domain you‚Äôre auditing).

 **Your user must have permissions to:**
- Query Active Directory (`Get-ADObject`)
- Read ACLs on AD objects
- Read Security Event Logs (`Get-WinEvent -LogName Security`)
